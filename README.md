# Java_Swing_Project
The project is on Basic Java Swing. In this project, I have used many basic concept. It is a Student Data Table in which one`s data could be added, updated, or deleted. There is a button for clearing the textbox to add new data for another person.

But this program doesn`t store data of table because it is not programmed to store data in DataBase.
